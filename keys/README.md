### PRIVATE KEY DISCLAMER
It's intended to have both public and private key inside this Github repository. It's for demonstration purposes only.
In case of a real deployment, of course, we'll change both keys and remove the private key from any Github repositories.
I perfectly understand that doing this is the worst practice ever.
